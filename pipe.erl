% pipe.erl
%
% This module implements a pipe data structure. This pipe implementation is
% designed as a fifo for bytes. You write bytes *to* the pipe and then can
% read those same bytes *from* the pipe. This is useful when dealing with
% chunked data from an external port. All of the chunked data can be written
% to the pipe and then you can read specific numbers of bytes from the pipe.
% This is necessary if you wish to do your own packet length management.
